// Package application owns a go-widgets app's whole lifecycle: it opens the
// native OS window, runs its event loop, blits the handler's own RGBA
// framebuffer into it, composes a system-tray / menu-bar icon alongside it, and
// fires a "ready" callback once the first frame is on screen. It is the sibling
// of go-widgets/window: window presents a single surface, application is the
// layer above it that turns a handler plus an identity (name, icon, tray) into a
// running application. There is no WebKit, no wasm, no HTTP — every widget is
// drawn by the framework (toolkit.Surface) and the window is just a bitmap
// surface plus a native event source. Everything is CGO_ENABLED=0.
//
// Opening a real OS window and pumping its event loop is inherently a
// launch-verified boundary, so the [Run] path through go-widgets/window is
// excluded from the coverage gate (like the wasm glue elsewhere); this contract,
// the event translation, the present gating, the appearance pump, the
// launch-height seam and the ready-after-first-frame counter are all unit-tested.
//
// The optional capability interfaces (AppearanceSink, ShortcutSink,
// SecondaryClicker, ContextMenuHost, ClipboardController, Accessible) are the
// reason the run loop must never WRAP a Handler: a wrapper would satisfy the
// bare Handler interface and silently drop every capability the concrete handler
// also implements. Everything here threads the ORIGINAL handler through, and
// type-asserts for a capability at the point of use.
